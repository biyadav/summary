# Java 8 (LTS)
Released in March 2014, Java 8 remains one of the most widely used versions of Java due to its stability and long support cycle. Key features include:

Lambda Expressions: Enabled functional programming by allowing methods to be treated as first-class citizens.
Streams API: Provides a powerful way to process collections of objects.
Default Methods: Allowed interfaces to have method implementations, improving backward compatibility.
Optional Class: Reduces null checks and helps prevent NullPointerException.

# Java 11 (LTS)
Released in September 2018, Java 11 was the first LTS after Java 8 and marked the start of a modern Java. Key features include:

Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters: Use var in lambda expressions.
HTTP Client (Standard): New HttpClient API replaces HttpURLConnection, with support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets.
Nest-Based Access Control: Improved encapsulation of nested classes.
Deprecation of Pack200: Various libraries were deprecated and removed, encouraging modernization.

# Java 17 (LTS)
Released in September 2021, Java 17 is the most popular choice for LTS migration after Java 11. Key features include:

Sealed Classes: Allows developers to define restricted class hierarchies.
Pattern Matching for instanceof: Simplifies type checking.
Records: Introduces compact syntax for immutable data classes.
Strong Encapsulation by Default: Further improves module system enforcement introduced in Java 9.
Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator): Facilitates better native interoperation.

# Java 21 (LTS)
Released in September 2023, Java 21 brings significant new features and improvements:

Pattern Matching for Switch: Adds a more expressive and safer switch.
Record Patterns: Enables pattern matching for record deconstruction.
Virtual Threads (Project Loom): Lightweight threads to simplify writing high-throughput, scalable applications.
Scoped Values: An enhancement in Project Loom to enable flexible state passing in threads.
Structured Concurrency (Incubator): Provides a model for concurrent tasks with lifecycles bound to parent tasks.
Foreign Function & Memory API (Final): Finalized API for efficient interoperation with native code.


# Performance Improvements
Java 11 and beyond have introduced substantial performance improvements, particularly for garbage collection, startup time, and memory usage.

Java 8: Uses Parallel GC by default.
Java 11: Introduces Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) and G1GC as the default GC for low-latency applications.
Java 17: G1GC and ZGC have been further optimized.
Java 21: Includes enhancements in Virtual Threads and improved garbage collection algorithms.

#  Tooling and API Enhancements

Java 8: Introduced some of the most widely adopted features like Lambda and Stream APIs.
Java 11: Introduced improvements like the new HttpClient and removed tools like javaws.
Java 17: Enhanced APIs like RandomGenerator, Stream, and Optional. Sealed Classes and Record Types became permanent.
Java 21: Includes finalized Foreign Function & Memory API and new APIs for structured concurrency.

# Deprecations and Removed Features

Java 11: Removed deprecated modules like java.xml.ws and tools like javaws.
Java 17: Deprecated the Security Manager and finalized the removal of older APIs like Nashorn JavaScript Engine.
Java 21: Continues this trend by further deprecating outdated features, improving the overall performance and security of the language.
