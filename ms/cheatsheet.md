## Microservice design pattern

Decomposition Patterns:  
 - Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Decompose services based on business domains.
 - Subdomain Decomposition: Break down a large domain into smaller subdomains.
   
Communication Patterns:  
 - API Gateway: A single entry point for all client requests.
 - Backend for Frontend (BFF): Separate backend services for different types of clients (e.g., mobile, web).
 - Service Mesh: A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication.

Data Management Patterns:  
 - Database per Service: Each microservice has its own database.
 - Shared Database: Multiple services share a single database (less common).
 - Event Sourcing: Store state changes as a sequence of events.
 - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Separate read and write operations.
 - 
Resilience Patterns:  
 - Circuit Breaker: Prevent cascading failures by stopping calls to a failing service.
 - Bulkhead: Isolate different parts of the system to prevent failure from spreading.
 - Retry: Automatically retry failed operations.
 - 
Observability Patterns:  
 - Log Aggregation: Collect and aggregate logs from different services.
 - Distributed Tracing: Trace requests as they flow through multiple services.
 - Health Check: Monitor the health of services.
   
Deployment Patterns:
 - Blue-Green Deployment: Deploy new versions alongside old ones and switch traffic gradually.
 - Canary Release: Gradually roll out new versions to a subset of users.
 - Service Discovery: Automatically detect and connect to service instances.
   
Security Patterns:  
 - Access Token: Use tokens for authentication and authorization.
 - API Gateway Security: Implement security at the API gateway level.

## Best Practices 
 
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each microservice should have a single responsibility and encapsulate a specific business capability.  
- API Gateway: Use an API Gateway to handle common concerns such as authentication, logging, rate limiting, and routing.  
- Decentralized Data Management: Each microservice should manage its own database to ensure loose coupling and independent scalability.  
- Service Discovery: Implement service discovery to enable microservices to find each other dynamically.  
- Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Use patterns like Circuit Breaker, Retry, and Bulkhead to handle failures gracefully and ensure system resilience.  
- Automated Testing: Implement comprehensive automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to ensure the reliability of microservices.  
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.  
- Monitoring and Logging: Implement centralized logging and monitoring to gain insights into the health and performance of microservices.  
- Security: Secure microservices by implementing authentication, authorization, and encryption. Use OAuth2 and JWT for secure communication.  
- Versioning: Use versioning for APIs to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions between different versions.  
- Scalability: Design microservices to be horizontally scalable to handle increased load by adding more instances.  
- Loose Coupling: Ensure microservices are loosely coupled and communicate through well-defined APIs to allow independent development and deployment.  
- Data Consistency: Use eventual consistency and patterns like Saga for managing distributed transactions across microservices.  
- Documentation: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for APIs and microservices to facilitate development and maintenance.
